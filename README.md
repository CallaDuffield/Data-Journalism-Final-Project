# Data-Journalism-Final-Project
This repository documents my analysis of change in California's wildfire spread from 2016 to 2021 and Cal Fire's funding and legislation response.
# Analysis 1: How many acres were burned by California wildfires in 2016 and 2021? What is the percent change between the two years?
## Data Analysis Process: 
1) Select the "2021" sheet.
2) Find the sum of the "ACRES" column by selecting it, clicking "data", and selecting "column stats." Scroll down to where "sum" is listed to find value.
3) Replicate this process with the "2016" sheet.

### 2,610,049 acres were burned by wildfires in California in 2021

![Sheet Used; 2016](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/109619716/183372881-33c9ba6f-3a03-466b-8e70-745327405d40.png)
### 500,281 acres were burned by wildfires in California in 2016

## Data Analysis Process:
In a new sheet called "Calculations", use the (New-Old)/Old x 100 formula to subtract the sum in 2021 from the sum in 2016, then divide the result by the sum in 2016. Multiply the result by 100 to find the percent change in total wildfire acreage from 2016 to 2021.
1) Input the 2016 value in cell A1, and input the 2021 value in cell B1. We will use these for our calculation.
2) In cell C1, set up the function using the formula =SUM(B1-A1).
3) In cell D1, divide the output by A1 using the formula =DIVIDE(C1,A1).
4) In cell E1, multiply the result by 100 to find the percent change by using the formula =MULTIPLY(D1, 100).

### California's yearly wildfire burn acreage rose 421.72% from 2016 to 2021.


# Analysis 2: Which counties had the greatest and fewest total wildfires in 2016 and 2021?
## Data Analysis Process: 
1) Pay attention to fires that spanned multiple counties. Duplicate sheet "2016".
2) Sort rows alphabetically from A to Z by "COUNTIES" column. In row 32, El Dorado and Placer are listed in the same cell. Duplicate the row by inserting a row above and pasting the data. Isolate El Dorado in one "COUNTIES" cell and Placer in the other, with the rest of the cells staying the same.
3) Do the same for sheet "2021". Duplicate it, and sort rows aphabetically from A to Z by "COUNTIES" column. In row 9, Butte, Plumas, Shasta, Lassen and Tehama are all listed in the same cell. Repeat the process of step 2, and isolate all 5 counties in seperate rows. Do the same for the clustered counties in row 23, 89, 92, 116, 158 and 169.
4) Make a pivot table with the sheet "2016" and lable it "2016 Fire by Counties".
5) Insert "COUNTIES" into rows and "ACRES" into values. Summarize "ACRES" by COUNTA.
6) Filter "ACRES" from Z to A to find the county with the greatest number of wildfires. Then filter from A to Z to find the county with the fewest number of wildfires.
7) Repeat these steps with the sheet "2021," and lable the pivot table "2021 Fire by Counties".

### Fresno and Kern both had 12 wildfires in 2016

### Riverside had 18 wildfires in 2021
